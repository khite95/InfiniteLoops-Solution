IL-0001 Cannot Add Items to Cart

Users are being shown a cryptic error message each time they click
"Add To Cart." This happens for every item shown under 'Available Loops.'

This trace appears in my console:
TypeError: t.getProductById(...) is undefined
    Z ShoppingCartPreview.vue:1


Expected:
1. As a User, I should be able to add items to my cart
2. Items in my cart should be displayed when I click the
shopping cart icon in the header



IL-0002 Total Is not Properly Formatted in Shopping Cart

Users are reporting that occasionally, the total shown has more than
two decimal values (See IL0002.png)

Expected:
1. As a User, when my cart is not empty, I should see the total value
in my Shopping Cart Component
2. The Total value shown should have exactly two decimal places (for cents)



IL-0003 Unable to Create Order "Missing Email"

Users are reporting that they cannot complete their order, with items
in their shopping carts.

They are shown a notice that their oder is being created, but upon further
inspection, they are receiving a 400 Bad Request from `/api/v1/orders`

"Unable to create order. Missing email"

Most of the affected users have confirmed that they _did_ include an email
address. We have been able to reproduce reliably on our end.
